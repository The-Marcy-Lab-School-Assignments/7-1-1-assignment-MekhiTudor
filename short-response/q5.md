# Question

With React Router, which of the following path(s) will match the `/products/:id` path?

1. `/products`
2. `/products/apple`
3. `/products/5`
4. `/products/5/about`

Explain your answer.

# Answer

`./products/5` because `:id` is the dynamic path, it could also be `/products/apple` if apple was the id. but the other ones either are to shallow or to deep to be directed to the right place.
