# Question

What are the benefits of single-page apps (SPAs) versus multi-page apps (MPAs)?

# Answer

Single-page apps are faster and more responsive, since you don't have to reload the entire page and are just loading and switching between which components are visible. Multi-page apps requires request to be sent and can be less dynamic.
